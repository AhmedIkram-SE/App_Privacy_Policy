<p>Welcome to the StudU app for Android!</p>
<p>As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="data-collected-by-the-app">Data collected by the app</h3>
<p>I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (the assignments files and a profile Image) is uploaded safely to the firebase SDK, which I am using in this app, and can simply be deleted by deleting to your account directly from the app. No analytics software is present in the app either.</p>
<h3 id="explanation-of-permissions-requested-in-the-app">Explanation of permissions requested in the app</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Permission</th>
<th>Why it is required</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code></td>
<td>This permission allows the app to connect to internet, which is esential for the functioning of this app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code></td>
<td>This permission allows the reading of just PDF files and jpg images which is essential for the functionality of uploading files and setting a user profile photo. These files and photos are safely secured in the firebase storage SDK, and are not shared with any other third party, and are not used by the developer.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br>M. Ahmed.<br>m.ahmed.ikram2003@gmail.com</p>
